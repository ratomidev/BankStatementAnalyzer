KISS
keep it simple, stupid

SRP
single responsability principle

GODCLASS
class that contain all the responsability

ANTI PATTERN CODE
code that contain duplication
difficul to solve and test

DRY
don't repeat your self

COHESION
low cohesion is how strongly related responsabilities of a class or a methode.

HOW TO GROUPE METHODES ?
functional : do the same thing, recommanded
informational : work on the same data or domain , recommanded
utility : should be avoited , it used to contain multiple methods that not related.
logical : not recommanded because it brank the SRP, it groups the logical method.
sequential: not recommanded break SRP.
temporal: function that should be called in specific order of time

COUPLING: how things is depended for each others.
